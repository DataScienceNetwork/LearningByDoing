# LearningByDoing with Numpy 
The overall idea of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning, practice describing the different processes in building a ML model and experimenting with programming a ML model from scratch. 

## Pair 1 
We decided to build a simple regression model to predict a sinuscurve build in python using mainly Numpy.
