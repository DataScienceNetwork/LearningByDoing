# LearningByDoing with Numpy 
The overall idea of this project is to 

- Gain a deeper understanding of machine learning, specifically neural networks
- Practice describing the different processes in building a ML model
- Experimenting with programming a ML model from scratch 

## Pair 1 
We decided to build a simple regression model to predict a sine curve build in python using mainly Numpy. The group members have spent some time studying the subject of neural networks and described important processes and features invovled in building a NN. We also created a script that generates and plots two sine curves, which can be used as input data. Our initial idea was to use the input data, try different weights and sum the inputs with the weights. Next, was to program a activation function, get an output and use the output in a loss function to determine how well the model performs. 

## Pair 2 
The next group can decided to either focus on studying and describing NN theory or begin to program a NN model using Numpy. Or both if they decided too.
